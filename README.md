# AI Test Case Generator Agent (Python)

This project provides a simple AI agent that:

1. Reads user stories from `requirement_stories.txt`
2. Sends those stories to an LLM
3. Generates structured test cases
4. Saves output to `generated_testcases.md`

## Project structure

- `agent.py` - Main script for running the test case generation flow.
- `requirement_stories.txt` - Input file where you maintain your user stories.
- `generated_testcases.md` - Output file generated by the agent.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An LLM API key (OpenAI-compatible chat completion endpoint)

## Environment variables

Set these before running:

- `LLM_API_KEY` (required)
- `LLM_MODEL` (optional, default: `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `LLM_BASE_URL` (optional, default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`)

## Run in PyCharm

1. Open this folder in PyCharm.
2. Configure a Python interpreter.
3. Add environment variables in **Run/Debug Configurations**.
4. Run:

```bash
python agent.py
```

## Input format (`requirement_stories.txt`)

Keep simple user stories, one per paragraph or numbered list. Example:

```text
1. As a registered user, I want to log in with email and password so I can access my dashboard.
2. As a user, I should see an error message when credentials are invalid.
```

## Output

The agent writes detailed test cases in markdown to `generated_testcases.md` with:

- Test Case ID
- Title
- Preconditions
- Test Data
- Test Steps
- Expected Result
- Priority (High/Medium/Low)
- Type (Positive/Negative/Edge)

## Notes

- This is intentionally lightweight so you can expand it as your AI agent grows.
- You can later add memory, vector search, and multi-agent orchestration.
